            <h2>Programming Language</h2>
            <p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>

            <p> The earliest known programmable machine that preceded the invention of the digital computer was the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] From the early 1800s, "programs" were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxs and player pianos.[2] Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use other forms of program specification such as the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).</p>

            <p> The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>

            <h2>Rising Enterprises</h2>
            <p>If you follow enterprise technology, then you know that there are certain household names that everybody knows by now. Like Aaron Levie, the 29-year-old-wunderkind CEO of Box, and Marc Benioff, the battle tested veteran CEO of salesforce.com.</p>

            <p>  Here are some rising stars who you may not know – yet. Each is doing his/her part to positively impact the future of enterprise technology and all are simultaneously raising the bar at their respective organization.</p>

            <p>   Together, these enterprise technology entrepreneurs, investors, and corporate executives have raised tens of million dollars in venture capital, have had hundred million dollar exits, and have managed hundreds of million dollars in assets.</p>

            <h2>Rising Start-up's</h2>
            <p>2018 is almost upon us and so it is once again time to predict which startups will take the tech industry by storm next year.
                Who better to ask than the startup experts, the VCs that watch the industry, guide the startups, hear their pitches, and invest in them?</p>

            <p>  We reached out to a number of top VCs and asked them which startups will boom in 2018. We invited participation from investors from a variety of backgrounds and investing philosophies. This includes some of the top VCs in the Valley (Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Battery Ventures, Bessemer, Greylock Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia).</p>

            <p> We included VCs of note who specialize in seed and early rounds (8VC, Bloomberg Beta, BBG Ventures — which backs startups with at least one female founder.) We also asked some top VCs from the startup nation Israel (JVP, OurCrowd) and VCs that have been known for picking hits (like IVP's Somash Dash).</p>

            <p>    We asked them to name a company they've backed that's on track to have a great 2018. After all, they believed in those companies so much they invested. But we also asked them to name another startup they think is cool that they don't have any financial interest in.</p>

            <p>    As startup lovers, they gave us this list chock full of amazing up-and-comers creating tech for businesses, gamers, personalized health, robots, high-tech money, new forms of super computers, and even outer space.</p>
